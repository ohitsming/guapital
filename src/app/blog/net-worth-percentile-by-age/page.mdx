Understanding where you stand financially compared to your peers can be incredibly motivating. Whether you're just starting your wealth-building journey or well on your way to financial independence, knowing your net worth percentile provides valuable context for your progress.

## What is Net Worth?

Net worth is simply the total value of everything you own (assets) minus everything you owe (liabilities). It's the single best metric for measuring overall financial health.

**Assets include:**
- Cash and savings accounts
- Investment accounts (401k, IRA, brokerage)
- Real estate equity
- Cryptocurrency holdings
- Vehicles and other valuable property

**Liabilities include:**
- Student loans
- Credit card debt
- Mortgages
- Car loans
- Personal loans

## Net Worth Percentiles by Age

Based on Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 2022 data combined with real Guapital user data, here's how net worth breaks down by age bracket:

### Ages 18-24

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 25th       | -$3,500   |
| 50th       | $7,000    |
| 75th       | $28,000   |
| 90th       | $65,000   |

**Reality check:** Most young adults in this bracket are dealing with student debt or just starting their careers. Breaking even (zero net worth) already puts you ahead of many peers.

### Ages 25-29

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 25th       | $1,200    |
| 50th       | $24,000   |
| 75th       | $92,000   |
| 90th       | $185,000  |

**Key insight:** This is where career momentum starts to show. Tech workers, early crypto investors, and those with equity compensation can reach top percentiles faster.

### Ages 30-34

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 25th       | $18,000   |
| 50th       | $87,000   |
| 75th       | $247,000  |
| 90th       | $485,000  |

**Wealth building accelerates:** By 30, compound interest and career growth create significant separation between percentiles. Reaching $250K puts you in the top 25%.

### Ages 35-39

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 25th       | $42,000   |
| 50th       | $135,000  |
| 75th       | $376,000  |
| 90th       | $720,000  |

**FIRE territory:** Many in the 90th percentile are on track for early retirement. Home equity and investment portfolios are major contributors.

## How to Improve Your Percentile Ranking

### 1. Track Your Net Worth Consistently

You can't improve what you don't measure. **Use Guapital to automatically track your net worth** across all accounts - checking, savings, investments, crypto, and debts.

### 2. Maximize High-Growth Assets

- **Invest in index funds:** Historically 7-10% annual returns
- **Consider crypto exposure:** 5-10% allocation for growth potential
- **Leverage employer 401k match:** Free money that compounds

### 3. Eliminate High-Interest Debt First

Credit card debt at 20% APR will destroy wealth faster than any investment can build it. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt before aggressive investing.

### 4. Increase Your Savings Rate

The #1 factor in reaching top percentiles is consistent savings. Aim for:
- **Good:** 10-15% of gross income
- **Great:** 20-30% of gross income
- **FIRE mode:** 50%+ of gross income

### 5. Don't Forget Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Maxing out 401k ($23,000/year) and IRA ($7,000/year) contributions accelerates wealth building through tax savings and forced consistency.

## Why Percentile Ranking Matters

Traditional financial advice focuses on arbitrary goals like "save $1 million by 65." But context matters. **$500K at age 32 is exceptional.** $500K at age 60 is falling behind.

Percentile rankings give you:
- **Realistic goals** based on peer comparisons
- **Motivation** to see your progress over time
- **Context** for whether you're on track for financial independence

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's a good net worth for my age?

There's no universal "good" number, but reaching the 50th percentile (median) means you're doing better than half your peers. Anything above the 75th percentile is considered excellent.

### Should I include my home equity?

Yes. Net worth calculations include all assets, including home equity (home value minus mortgage balance). However, remember that primary residence equity is less liquid than investments.

### How often should I check my percentile?

Monthly or quarterly is ideal. Checking too frequently can lead to anxiety over short-term market fluctuations. Focus on long-term trends.

### Can I reach the top 10% without a high income?

Absolutely. High savings rate matters more than high income. Someone earning $80K saving 40% will build wealth faster than someone earning $150K saving 10%.
