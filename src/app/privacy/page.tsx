                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">1. Scope of Data Collection</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We may collect, process, and store any and all information you provide, generate, or that is otherwise obtained through your use of the Services, whether directly, indirectly, automatically, or through third-party integrations (“Collected Data”). Collected Data includes, without limitation: personal identifiers; demographic information; contact information; account credentials; device, browser, and network data; location data; behavioral and usage analytics; financial and transactional data; survey responses; communications with us or other users; and any other information, regardless of format, that may be reasonably associated with you or your account now or in the future. This definition applies to all current and future methods of collection.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">2. Purpose and Legal Basis</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We process Collected Data for the operation, improvement, personalization, and security of the Services; to enable AI-powered survey generation and analysis; to comply with applicable legal obligations; and to enforce our Terms of Service. Where required by law, we rely on your consent or our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">3. Use of Collected Data</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Collected Data may be used to operate, maintain, and improve the Services; to verify identities; to process payments for subscriptions and features; to prevent fraud or misuse; to communicate with you; to facilitate AI-powered survey generation and analysis; to analyze usage trends; and for any lawful business purpose. You acknowledge and agree that we may combine Collected Data with other information obtained from public or private sources to improve our services and user experience.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    We may disclose Collected Data to: (a) service providers, including payment processors and analytics providers; (b) governmental authorities where required by law; and (c) other third parties in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. We disclaim all liability for how third parties process or use Collected Data once disclosed in accordance with this Policy, and you are solely responsible for ensuring any third-party use meets your own compliance requirements.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">5. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Collected Data may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in jurisdictions other than your own. By using the Services, you consent to such transfers, even where such jurisdictions may have different or less protective data protection laws than your own. We will implement legally recognized mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses where required, but we do not guarantee that such transfers will meet the data protection standards of your jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We retain Collected Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Retention periods may vary by data type and applicable law. Once Collected Data is no longer required, we may delete it or anonymize it in our discretion without notice to you.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">7. Security Measures</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Collected Data. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all liability for any unauthorized access to, use of, or disclosure of Collected Data, whether arising from a breach of our systems, those of a third-party provider, or otherwise, provided we have implemented such reasonable measures.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">8. Your Rights</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your Collected Data, as well as to object to certain processing activities or request data portability. To exercise these rights, contact us at the address provided below. We may require verification of identity before fulfilling any request and may deny requests where permitted by law.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">9. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect Collected Data from such individuals. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any use of the Services by a minor is lawful and authorized.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without prior notice, except where applicable law requires notice.
