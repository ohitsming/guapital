                <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                    <li className="mb-2">We may use your anonymized net worth data (age bracket + net worth snapshots) to calculate percentile rankings</li>

                    <li className="mb-2">Your exact net worth will never be shared with other users - only aggregated, anonymized statistics are used</li>
