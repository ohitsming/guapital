## 1. Welcome to Guapital: See Where You Rank and Where You're Headed

**Slug:** `welcome-to-guapital`

**Summary:**
Comprehensive product launch announcement positioning Guapital as the only net worth tracker that answers "Am I actually doing well for my age?" through percentile rankings. Contrasts Guapital's wealth-building focus against competitors (YNAB's budget-first approach, Monarch's lack of context, Personal Capital's advisor upsells). Deep dive into five unique differentiators: percentile rankings using hybrid Federal Reserve + real user data, first-class multi-chain crypto support (5 blockchains), privacy-first subscription model (no data selling), wealth trajectory projections with per-account monthly contributions, and elimination of budget shame in favor of big-picture net worth growth. Includes detailed comparison tables, honest pricing breakdown ($99/yr vs competitors), feature walkthrough (auto-sync via Plaid for 11,000+ institutions, manual entry, crypto wallet tracking), security architecture explanation, and 6-step getting started guide. Concludes with founding member offer ($79/yr for first 1,000 users) and clear positioning: choose Guapital for percentile insights and crypto tracking, choose competitors for budgeting features.
