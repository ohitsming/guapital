**LocalMoco** is an AI-powered tool that helps businesses create high-quality surveys and feedback forms in seconds. Stop guessing at what questions to ask and let AI build an effective survey based on your goals.

## üåé Project Overview

For most businesses, finding the right market fit is a critical challenge. The biggest hurdle in validating ideas and understanding customer needs isn't just gathering feedback, but asking the *right* questions to get actionable data. LocalMoco solves this by using generative AI to transform your business goals into a well-structured, unbiased survey, helping you confidently validate market fit and drive product success.

**The core workflow is simple:**

1.  **Describe Your Goal:** Tell the AI what you want to learn. For example:
    *   *"Test a new logo for my coffee brand."*
    *   *"Get feedback on a new feature for my SaaS app."*
    *   *"Understand customer satisfaction with my e-commerce store."*
2.  **Generate Survey:** The AI engine drafts a survey with relevant, unbiased, and effective questions.
3.  **Distribute & Analyze:** Share your survey via a simple link and watch the results come in through a clean, easy-to-understand dashboard.

This approach saves time, reduces bias, and dramatically increases the quality of insights you receive.

## USP

1. Core USP: Go from Goal to Questions, Instantly.
    * Pain Solved: The "Blank Page" problem.
    * Your Feature: A user types a simple goal ("I want to test a new pricing model for my SaaS product"), and your AI generates a statistically sound, 
        unbiased, and well-structured survey. This is your hook.

2. AI-Powered Analysis & Reporting.
    * Pain Solved: Analysis paralysis.
    * Your Feature: This is your knockout punch. After responses are collected, the AI doesn't just give the user a CSV file. It automatically:
        * Analyzes sentiment of open-ended responses.
        * Identifies key themes and clusters similar comments.
        * Generates a summary report in plain English, complete with charts and key takeaways (e.g., "73% of users found the pricing confusing, with many 
            mentioning the 'Pro' tier as the main point of friction.").
    * Why it Wins: Google Forms and SurveyMonkey make the user do all this work manually. You do it for them.
