## What Is Guapital?

Guapital is a **privacy-first net worth tracker** designed for young professionals who hold diverse assets across traditional investments, crypto, and emerging asset classes. Unlike traditional budgeting apps (like YNAB or Mint) that focus on every transaction, Guapital takes a big-picture approach: track your assets and liabilities, see your net worth grow over time, and understand where you rank compared to your peers.

### Core Features

**Asset Tracking:**
- **Automatic bank/investment sync** via Plaid (Premium)
- **Multi-chain crypto tracking** (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- **Manual asset entry** (real estate, vehicles, stock options, collectibles)
- **Liability tracking** (student loans, mortgages, credit card debt)

**Insights & Analytics:**
- **Percentile ranking** (see where you stand vs. peers by age)
- **Historical net worth charts** (track progress over time)
- **FIRE trajectory calculator** (project your path to financial independence)
- **Transaction history** (Premium: categorize and analyze spending patterns)

**Privacy & Control:**
- **No data selling** (subscription-based model)
- **Bank-level encryption** (AES-256, zero-knowledge architecture)
- **Anonymous percentile opt-in** (your choice, always)
- **Export your data anytime** (CSV download)

<a id="who-is-guapital-for"></a>
## Who Is Guapital For?

Guapital is built for **tech workers, entrepreneurs, and young professionals** who:

✅ **Have $50K-$500K net worth** (our sweet spot, but all are welcome)
✅ **Hold crypto or DeFi assets** (finally, a tracker that gets it)
✅ **Want to build wealth, not count pennies** (focus on the big picture)
✅ **Value privacy** (we never sell your data)
✅ **Ask "Am I on track?"** (percentile ranking answers this)

### Who We're NOT For

❌ **If you need detailed budgeting** (try YNAB or EveryDollar)
❌ **If you want investment advice** (we're a tracker, not an advisor)
❌ **If you're anti-crypto** (we embrace emerging assets)
❌ **If you expect free auto-sync forever** (we're subscription-based for sustainability)

<a id="why-net-worth-tracking-matters"></a>
## Why Net Worth Tracking Matters More Than Budgeting

Here's a truth many financial apps won't tell you: **tracking every transaction doesn't automatically make you wealthy**.

Budget-tracking apps focus on *income and expenses*—which are important, but they only tell part of the story. Net worth tracking, on the other hand, shows your **total financial picture**:

**Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities**

This simple formula captures:
- Your savings account balance ($10,000)
- Your investment portfolio ($75,000)
- Your crypto holdings ($15,000)
- Your home equity ($50,000)
- Minus your student loans ($-30,000)
- Minus your credit card debt ($-2,000)

**Result: $118,000 net worth**

### Why This Matters

1. **Wealth is accumulated assets, not high income**
   A doctor earning $300K/year with $400K in loans may have *lower* net worth than a software engineer earning $120K with $150K invested.

2. **Net worth tracking forces you to think long-term**
   Instead of obsessing over a $50 dinner, you focus on: "Did I increase my net worth this month?"

3. **You can't improve what you don't measure**
   Most people have no idea what their net worth is. By tracking it monthly, you create accountability.

4. **Percentile context motivates progress**
   Knowing you're in the 60th percentile—and seeing what it takes to reach the 75th—gives you a tangible goal.

According to a [2022 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm), the median net worth for Americans aged 25-29 is just $39,000. By 35-39, it's $135,000. If you're tracking your net worth, you can benchmark your progress against national data (and Guapital's real user data).

## The Guapital Difference: Percentile Ranking

This is our **killer feature**—the one thing no competitor offers.

### What Is Percentile Ranking?

Percentile ranking shows **where you stand financially compared to others in your age group**. If you're in the 75th percentile, that means your net worth is higher than 75% of people your age.

**Example:**
- You're 28 years old with $150,000 net worth
- Guapital tells you: "You're in the **75th percentile** for your age"
- This means: 75% of 28-year-olds have *less* net worth than you
- To reach top 10% (90th percentile), you'd need ~$255,000

### How We Calculate This

We use a **hybrid approach** combining:

1. **Federal Reserve SCF data** (Survey of Consumer Finances, 2022)
   - 49 data points across 7 age brackets (18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50+)
   - Percentiles: 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th

2. **Real Guapital user data** (anonymized, opt-in only)
   - As our user base grows, we blend real-world data with SCF benchmarks
   - This makes percentiles more accurate for tech workers and young professionals

### Why This Is Unique

**No competitor offers this.** Here's why:

| Feature | Guapital | Monarch Money | Copilot | YNAB |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|------|
| Percentile ranking | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Crypto tracking | ✅ Multi-chain | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Privacy-first | ✅ Paid model | ⚠️ Mixed | ✅ Paid | ✅ Paid |
| Mobile-first | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ iOS only | ⚠️ Desktop-first |
| Budget tracking | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅✅ Best-in-class |

**The moat:** Building percentile ranking requires:
- Critical mass of users (for accurate benchmarks)
- Database infrastructure (we have 3 tables, 3 APIs, daily cron jobs)
- Trust (users must opt-in to share anonymous data)
- 6-12 months of dev time (we've done the work)

By the time competitors catch up, we'll have SEO authority, user trust, and better data.

## How Guapital Works

### Step 1: Connect Your Accounts

**Option A: Automatic Sync (Premium)**
- Connect bank accounts, credit cards, and investment accounts via [Plaid](https://plaid.com)

- Supports 11,000+ institutions (Chase, Bank of America, Fidelity, Robinhood, etc.)

**Option B: Manual Entry (Free)**
- Add assets manually (cash, real estate, vehicles, stock options, collectibles)
- Add liabilities (student loans, mortgages, personal loans)
- Update balances monthly (or weekly, your choice)

**Option C: Crypto Tracking (Free for 2 wallets)**
- Add wallet addresses (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Auto-syncs token balances via [Alchemy API](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- See USD value in real-time (powered by CoinGecko)

### Step 2: See Your Net Worth Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:
- **Total Net Worth** (big number at the top)
- **Assets breakdown** (bank accounts, investments, crypto, manual)
- **Liabilities breakdown** (loans, credit cards, mortgages)
- **30-day or 365-day historical chart** (track progress over time)
- **Percentile rank** (if you opt in)

### Step 3: Track Progress Over Time

Every day at midnight UTC, we take a snapshot of your net worth. Over time, this creates a trend line showing your financial trajectory.

**Example visualization:**

```
Net Worth Over Time
$180K |                                  ●
$160K |                         ●     ●
$140K |                ●     ●
$120K |       ●     ●
$100K |    ●
       ┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴
      Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul
```

**Privacy note:** Percentile data is:
- **Anonymous** (no personal info linked to your net worth)
- **Opt-in only** (you must explicitly consent)
