# Welcome to Guapital: See Where You Rank and Where You're Headed

You're making good money. You've got investments, maybe some crypto, a 401(k), and a growing bank account.

But here's what keeps you up at night: **"Am I actually doing well for my age?"**

Most finance apps won't give you a straight answer. They either guilt you about every coffee purchase or ignore half your assets.

You need something different. That's where Guapital comes in.

We're a privacy-first net worth tracker that shows you the complete picture. Stocks, crypto, real estate, loans. And we tell you exactly where you stand compared to your peers.

## Key Takeaways

- See where you rank with percentile rankings (the only tracker that shows if you're on track for your age)
- Project your wealth 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 years into the future with per-account growth tracking
- Track crypto across 5 blockchains with automatic syncing
- Your data stays private (we make money from subscriptions, not selling your info)
- Connect 11,000+ banks through Plaid for automatic updates
- Add monthly contributions to see compound growth (no salary tracking required)
- Focus on wealth building, not budget shame
- Start free with unlimited manual entries and 2 crypto wallets

<a id="why-choose-guapital"></a>
## Why Choose Guapital Over Other Apps?

Let's be real about what's out there.

### The Problem With Existing Apps

**YNAB** is great if you want to budget every dollar. But it won't tell you your net worth. If you have crypto, stock options, or real estate? YNAB can't help.

**Monarch Money** comes close. It'll show you that your net worth is $180,000. But is that good? Are you ahead or behind? Monarch won't tell you.

**Personal Capital** (now Empower) wants to sell you investment advice. They're not a neutral tracker. They're trying to become your financial advisor.

### Why Guapital Is Different

Here's what makes us stand out.

#### 1. Percentile Rankings (What Makes Us Unique)

Say you're 28 with $150K net worth. Sound good?

With Monarch, you'd see: "Your net worth is $150,000." Okay... and?

With Guapital, you'd see: "You're in the 75th percentile for 28-year-olds. To reach the top 10%, you'd need around $255K."

See the difference? You finally get context. You know if you're ahead or behind. You understand what "wealthy" actually means for your age.

No other app gives you this.

#### 2. First-Class Crypto Support

Most apps barely support crypto. Some don't support it at all.

Guapital tracks crypto across 5 blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Add your wallet address once. Balances update automatically. You see your crypto value in USD right next to your traditional assets.

If you hold even $1,000 in crypto, most competitors can't help you. Or they make you type in new values every time the price changes. Not fun.

#### 3. Privacy-First (We Never Sell Your Data)

Ever wonder how "free" apps make money? They sell your data.

Mint and Credit Karma sell your information to advertisers. That's their business model.

Guapital charges $99/year for Premium. That's how we make money. We don't need to sell your data because you're paying us directly.

You're the customer, not the product.

#### 4. No Budget Shame

Budgeting apps love to make you feel guilty. Every purchase gets categorized. Every overspend gets flagged. It's exhausting.

Guapital asks one simple question: "Did my net worth grow this month?"

You can spend $500 on dinner and still be ahead if your investments grew $5,000. That's the big-picture view budgeting apps miss.

#### 5. Wealth Trajectory Projections

Want to know where you'll be in 10 years? 20 years? 30?

Guapital projects your future net worth based on each account's growth rate. Retirement accounts compound at 7%. Mortgages pay down over time. Crypto grows (or shrinks) based on historical averages.

But here's the powerful part: add monthly contributions to any account. Contributing $500/month to your 401(k)? Add it. DCA-ing $200/month into crypto? Track it.

The result? You see your exact path to financial independence. No salary tracking required (privacy win).

This isn't just a FIRE calculator. It's a complete wealth projection engine that shows you:
- When you'll hit $1M net worth
- When your net worth will double
- How each account grows over time
- The impact of extra debt payments

No competitor offers per-account projections with monthly contributions built in.

<a id="who-is-guapital-for"></a>
## Who Is Guapital For?

Guapital is built for anyone who:

- Wants to track their finances and build wealth
- Holds diverse assets (crypto, investments, real estate, etc.)
- Prefers the big picture over tracking every penny
- Values privacy and data security
- Asks "Am I on track?" and wants a real answer

### Who We're NOT For

We're not right for everyone. Skip Guapital if you:

- Need detailed budgeting tools (try YNAB or EveryDollar)
- Want investment advice (we're a tracker, not an advisor)
- Don't hold any crypto and don't plan to
- Expect free auto-sync forever (we're subscription-based)

<a id="why-net-worth-tracking-matters"></a>
## Why Net Worth Tracking Matters More Than Budgeting

Here's a truth most financial apps won't tell you.

Tracking every transaction doesn't automatically make you wealthy.

Budget apps focus on income and expenses. That's important. But it's only part of the story. Net worth tracking shows your complete financial picture.

**Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities**

This simple formula captures everything:
- Your savings ($10,000)
- Your investments ($75,000)
- Your crypto ($15,000)
- Your home equity ($50,000)
- Minus your student loans ($-30,000)
- Minus your credit card debt ($-2,000)

**Result: $118,000 net worth**

### Why This Matters

**Wealth is accumulated assets, not high income.**

A doctor earning $300K/year with $400K in loans may have lower net worth than a software engineer earning $120K with $150K invested.

**Net worth tracking makes you think long-term.**

Instead of stressing about a $50 dinner, you ask: "Did I grow my net worth this month?"

**You can't improve what you don't measure.**

Most people have no clue what their net worth is. Track it monthly and you create accountability.

**Percentile context motivates progress.**

Knowing you're in the 60th percentile gives you a tangible goal. Seeing what it takes to reach 75th? That's motivating.

According to the [2022 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm), the median net worth for Americans aged 25-29 is $39,000. By ages 35-39, it's $135,000. Guapital helps you benchmark your progress against this national data.

<a id="the-guapital-difference"></a>
## The Guapital Difference: Percentile Ranking

This is what makes Guapital special. No other net worth tracker offers this.

### What Is Percentile Ranking?

Percentile ranking shows where you stand financially compared to others in your age group.

If you're in the 75th percentile, that means your net worth is higher than 75% of people your age.

**Example:**
- You're 28 years old with $150,000 net worth
- Guapital tells you: "You're in the 75th percentile for your age"
- This means: 75% of 28-year-olds have less net worth than you
- To reach top 10% (90th percentile), you'd need around $255,000

### How We Calculate This

We use a hybrid approach combining:

**1. Federal Reserve SCF data** (Survey of Consumer Finances, 2022)
- 49 data points across 7 age brackets
- Percentiles: 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th

**2. Real Guapital user data** (anonymized, opt-in only)
- As our user base grows, we blend real-world data with SCF benchmarks
- This makes percentiles more accurate and relevant for our diverse user community

### Why This Is Unique

No competitor offers this. Here's why:

| Feature | Guapital | Monarch Money | Copilot | YNAB |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|------|
| Net worth tracking | ✅✅ Primary | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Basic |
| Wealth trajectory | ✅ Per-account | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Percentile ranking | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Crypto tracking | ✅ Multi-chain | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Privacy-first | ✅ Paid model | ⚠️ Mixed | ✅ Paid | ✅ Paid |
| Mobile-first | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ iOS only | ⚠️ Desktop-first |
| Budget tracking | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅✅ Best-in-class |

**Why this is hard to copy:** Building percentile ranking requires:
- Lots of users (for accurate benchmarks)
- Complex technical setup (we've built this already)
- User trust (people must opt-in to share anonymous data)
- 6-12 months of development work (we've done the heavy lifting)

This gives you something truly unique that other apps can't quickly replicate.
