# Net Worth Percentile by Age: Where Do You Rank in 2025?

If you've ever wondered "Am I doing well financially for my age?" you're not alone. Understanding where you stand compared to your peers is one of the most powerful tools for financial motivation and planning. This guide breaks down net worth percentiles by age using the latest Federal Reserve data, so you can see exactly where you rank—and what it takes to move up.

## Key Takeaways

- Net worth percentiles show how your wealth compares to others in your age group, based on Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances data
- The median (50th percentile) net worth for 25-29 year-olds is $39,000, rising to $135,000 by ages 35-39
- Reaching the 90th percentile (top 10%) requires $255,000 at age 28, but $800,000+ by age 45
- High savings rates (30%+) and consistent investing are the primary drivers of moving up percentiles
- Tracking your percentile progress over time creates accountability and motivation to build wealth
- Most young professionals underestimate their standing—you may be doing better than you think

## What Is Net Worth Percentile?

Net worth percentile tells you where you rank financially compared to others in your age group. If you're in the **75th percentile**, that means your net worth is higher than 75% of people your age—or put another way, only 25% of your peers have more wealth than you.

### How Percentiles Work

Percentiles divide a population into 100 equal groups:

- **10th percentile**: Bottom 10% (struggling financially)
- **25th percentile**: Bottom quarter (building foundation)
- **50th percentile (median)**: Middle of the pack (average)
- **75th percentile**: Top quarter (doing well)
- **90th percentile**: Top 10% (wealthy)
- **95th percentile**: Top 5% (very wealthy)
- **99th percentile**: Top 1% (ultra-wealthy)

### Data Source: Federal Reserve SCF

The data in this article comes from the Federal Reserve's **Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) 2022**, the most comprehensive source of wealth data in the United States. The SCF surveys thousands of American households every three years, collecting detailed information on assets, liabilities, income, and demographics.

## Why Percentiles Matter More Than Income

Your income tells you how much you earn. Your percentile tells you how much wealth you've built. These are very different metrics.

### Income vs. Wealth: A Critical Distinction

Consider two 32-year-olds:

**Person A:**
- Earns $300,000/year as a doctor
- Has $400,000 in student loans
- Has $50,000 in savings
- **Net worth: $-350,000** (negative!)
- **Percentile: Below 10th**

**Person B:**
- Earns $120,000/year as a software engineer
- Has no debt
- Has $150,000 invested (started saving at 22)
- **Net worth: $150,000**
- **Percentile: 75th**

Person B earns less than half of Person A's income, but has significantly higher net worth and is in a much better financial position. This is why percentiles matter—they measure accumulated wealth, not just earning power.

### Why This Creates Better Financial Behavior

When you focus on percentile ranking instead of income:

1. **You prioritize savings over spending** - A $200K salary means nothing if you spend $210K
2. **You think long-term** - Building wealth takes years of consistent behavior
3. **You avoid lifestyle inflation** - Raises go to investments, not bigger houses
4. **You value debt reduction** - Paying off $50K debt has the same effect as saving $50K
5. **You measure real progress** - Moving from 60th to 70th percentile is tangible achievement

## Net Worth Percentile by Age: Complete Breakdown

Here's what Americans actually have in net worth, broken down by age and percentile. All data from Federal Reserve SCF 2022.

### Ages 18-24 (Early Career)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | -$7,000   |
| 25th       | $1,000    |
| 50th (Median) | $8,000 |
| 75th       | $40,000   |
| 90th       | $100,000  |
| 95th       | $160,000  |

**Key insight:** Most young adults start with zero or negative net worth due to student loans. If you're 24 with $20,000 saved, you're already in the top 40%.

### Ages 25-29 (Foundation Building)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | -$12,000  |
| 25th       | $8,000    |
| 50th (Median) | $39,000 |
| 75th       | $134,000  |
| 90th       | $255,000  |
| 95th       | $380,000  |

**Key insight:** This is where wealth building accelerates. The gap between 50th and 75th percentile widens to $95,000—the difference between savers and spenders becomes clear.

### Ages 30-34 (Momentum Years)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | -$15,000  |
| 25th       | $30,000   |
| 50th (Median) | $90,000 |
| 75th       | $290,000  |
| 90th       | $520,000  |
| 95th       | $750,000  |

**Key insight:** Compound interest starts showing up. Those who started investing at 25 now have 6-figure portfolios. The 90th percentile requires aggressive saving (30-40% of income).

### Ages 35-39 (Peak Earning Begins)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | -$8,000   |
| 25th       | $55,000   |
| 50th (Median) | $135,000 |
| 75th       | $420,000  |
| 90th       | $800,000  |
| 95th       | $1,200,000 |

**Key insight:** This is where the top 10% separate. Reaching $800K requires either very high income + high savings rate, or early investing + time. The median more than triples from ages 25-29 to 35-39.

### Ages 40-44 (Middle Peak)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | $0        |
| 25th       | $90,000   |
| 50th (Median) | $190,000 |
| 75th       | $580,000  |
| 90th       | $1,200,000 |
| 95th       | $1,900,000 |

**Key insight:** Home equity starts contributing significantly. Many in this bracket bought homes in their late 20s/early 30s and have built substantial equity.

### Ages 45-49 (Pre-Retirement Surge)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | $5,000    |
| 25th       | $120,000  |
| 50th (Median) | $250,000 |
| 75th       | $750,000  |
| 90th       | $1,600,000 |
| 95th       | $2,500,000 |

**Key insight:** The top 25% have enough wealth to consider early retirement (Coast FIRE). The 90th percentile is solidly on track for traditional retirement or better.

### Ages 50+ (Pre-Retirement & Retirement)

| Percentile | Net Worth |
|------------|-----------|
| 10th       | $15,000   |
| 25th       | $180,000  |
| 50th (Median) | $350,000 |
| 75th       | $950,000  |
| 90th       | $2,100,000 |
| 95th       | $3,500,000 |

**Key insight:** The median 50+ American has enough to retire on a modest lifestyle ($350K × 4% = $14K/year + Social Security). The 90th percentile has true financial freedom.

## How to Calculate Your Net Worth

Your net worth is simple math:

**Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities**

### What Counts as Assets?

Include everything you own with monetary value:

**Cash & Equivalents:**
- Checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- Money market funds
- Cash on hand

**Investments:**
- 401(k) / 403(b) / 457
- Traditional IRA / Roth IRA
- Taxable brokerage accounts
- HSA (Health Savings Account)
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Crypto holdings (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)

**Real Estate:**
- Primary residence (current market value)
- Rental properties
- Land

**Vehicles:**
- Cars, trucks, motorcycles (current resale value)

**Other Assets:**
- Stock options (vested portion only)
- Business ownership stake
- Collectibles (if you'd actually sell them)

### What Counts as Liabilities?

Include everything you owe:

**Debt:**
- Student loans
- Credit card balances
- Auto loans
- Personal loans
- Mortgages
- Home equity lines of credit (HELOC)

**Don't Include:**
- Future earnings (salary is not an asset)
- Unvested stock options
- Social Security (not liquid)
- Pensions (not liquid)

### Example Calculation

**28-year-old software engineer:**
- Checking/savings: $25,000
- 401(k): $60,000
- Roth IRA: $30,000
- Taxable brokerage: $15,000
- Crypto: $5,000
- Car: $12,000
- **Total Assets: $147,000**

- Student loans: $20,000
- Car loan: $8,000
- **Total Liabilities: $28,000**

**Net Worth = $147,000 - $28,000 = $119,000**

**Percentile: ~70th for age 28** (between 50th: $39K and 75th: $134K)

## What It Takes to Reach Top Percentiles

Moving up percentiles requires understanding the math behind wealth building. Here's what it takes.

### To Reach 50th Percentile (Median)

**Ages 25-29: $39,000 target**
- Save $500/month starting at age 22
- Invest in index funds (7% annual return)
- Takes 6 years to reach $39K
- Alternative: $650/month for 5 years

**Ages 30-34: $90,000 target**
- Save $1,000/month starting at age 25
- Invest in index funds (7% annual return)
- Takes 7 years to reach $90K
- Alternative: $1,300/month for 5 years

**Key insight:** Reaching the median is achievable for anyone earning $60K+ with a 20-25% savings rate.

### To Reach 75th Percentile (Top Quarter)

**Ages 25-29: $134,000 target**
- Save $1,200/month starting at age 22
- Invest aggressively (80% stocks, 7% return)
- Takes 7 years to reach $134K
- Requires income of $60K+ and 30-40% savings rate

**Ages 30-34: $290,000 target**
- Save $2,000/month starting at age 25
- Invest consistently (no interruptions)
- Takes 9 years to reach $290K
- Requires income of $100K+ and 30-35% savings rate

**Key insight:** The top quarter is dominated by high earners with high savings rates. If you earn $80K, you'd need to save 40-50% to reach this tier.

### To Reach 90th Percentile (Top 10%)

**Ages 25-29: $255,000 target**
- Save $2,500/month starting at age 22
- Invest aggressively (80/20 stocks/bonds, 7% return)
- Takes 7 years to reach $255K
- Requires income of $120K+ and 35-40% savings rate
- OR: Start with windfall (inheritance, stock options)

**Ages 35-39: $800,000 target**
- Save $3,500/month starting at age 25
- Invest for 14 years at 7% return
- Alternative: $2,000/month + annual $20K bonus invested
- Requires income of $150K+ and 35-40% savings rate

**Key insight:** The top 10% is very hard to reach through savings alone unless you have high income ($120K+) AND live below your means. Many in this tier had windfalls (stock options, inheritance, real estate appreciation).

### To Reach 95th Percentile (Top 5%)

**Ages 35-39: $1,200,000 target**
- Requires either:
  - Very high income ($250K+) + 40% savings rate
  - Business ownership / stock options vesting
  - Real estate appreciation + equity buildup
  - Inheritance or windfall

**Key insight:** This tier is dominated by entrepreneurs, tech workers with stock comp, and high-income professionals who avoided lifestyle inflation.

## Common Mistakes That Lower Your Percentile

Most people don't reach higher percentiles not because they earn too little, but because they make these mistakes:

### 1. Lifestyle Inflation

**The trap:** You get a $20K raise, so you upgrade your car, move to a nicer apartment, and eat out more. Your savings rate stays flat.

**The fix:** Treat raises as automatic savings increases. If you were comfortable on $80K, you can still be comfortable on $80K while saving the extra $20K.

### 2. Ignoring High-Interest Debt

**The trap:** You carry $10K credit card debt at 22% APR while investing $500/month. The interest costs $2,200/year, negating your investment gains.

**The fix:** Pay off high-interest debt (>7% APR) before investing beyond employer 401(k) match.

### 3. Not Starting Early Enough

**The trap:** "I'll start saving when I make more money." At 25 you earn $60K and save nothing. At 30 you earn $90K and start saving $1,000/month.

**The math:**
- Start at 25, save $500/month → $290K by age 40
- Start at 30, save $1,000/month → $190K by age 40

**The fix:** Save something now, even if it's only $100/month. Time in market beats timing the market.

### 4. Underestimating Small Wins

**The trap:** You think "What's the point of saving $200/month? That's not going to make me rich."

**The math:** $200/month from age 25-65 at 7% return = $528,000. That's the difference between median ($350K) and 75th percentile ($950K) at age 50+.

**The fix:** Small consistent amounts beat large sporadic amounts. Automate it and forget about it.

### 5. Comparing to High-Income Peers

**The trap:** Your friends earn $200K+ at tech companies. You feel behind earning $80K.

**The reality:** If your friends spend all $200K while you save 30% of $80K, you'll out-wealth them in 20 years.

**The fix:** Track percentile progress, not income. Net worth is what matters.

<a id="track-percentile"></a>
## How to Track Your Percentile Over Time

Tracking your percentile creates accountability and motivation. Here's how to do it effectively:

### Method 1: Manual Tracking (Free)

1. **Calculate net worth quarterly** (every 3 months)
2. **Compare to SCF data** for your age bracket
3. **Log in spreadsheet:**
   - Date
   - Age
   - Net worth
   - Percentile
   - Change from last quarter

**Example log:**

| Date | Age | Net Worth | Percentile | Change |
|------|-----|-----------|------------|--------|
| Jan 2025 | 28 | $115,000 | 68th | - |
| Apr 2025 | 28 | $128,000 | 72nd | +4% |
| Jul 2025 | 28 | $141,000 | 74th | +2% |

### Method 2: Automated Tracking (Guapital)

Use a net worth tracker with built-in percentile ranking:

1. **Connect accounts** (bank, investment, crypto)
2. **Automatic net worth calculation** (daily updates)
3. **Percentile ranking** (updated daily based on age + net worth)
4. **Historical charts** (see progress over months/years)
5. **Milestone tracking** (celebrate reaching 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles)

**Why this works better:** Automation removes friction. You're more likely to track consistently when it happens automatically.

### What to Track Beyond Percentile

- **Savings rate** (percentage of income saved)
- **Investment returns** (are you beating inflation?)
- **Debt paydown** (track decline in liabilities)
- **Income growth** (track raises and promotions)

### Celebrating Milestones

Set percentile goals and celebrate when you hit them:

- **Reach 50th percentile:** You're officially "average" (better than 50% of peers)
- **Reach 75th percentile:** You're in the top quarter
- **Reach 90th percentile:** You're in the top 10% (financial independence territory)

Each milestone is a tangible achievement that took discipline and consistency.

<a id="faqs"></a>
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What percentile is considered "good" for my age?

There's no universal "good" percentile, but general guidelines:

- **Below 25th percentile:** Needs improvement (prioritize debt payoff and emergency fund)
- **25th-50th percentile:** Building foundation (on track if you're young)
- **50th-75th percentile:** Doing well (ahead of most peers)
- **75th-90th percentile:** Excellent (top quarter)
- **Above 90th percentile:** Wealthy (financial independence likely achievable)

If you're in the 50th percentile or higher, you're ahead of most Americans your age.

### How does home equity affect percentile?

Home equity counts as an asset (current home value minus mortgage balance). For ages 35+, home equity is often 30-50% of total net worth.

**Example:** You bought a $400K home with 10% down in 2020. In 2025 it's worth $500K, you owe $330K on the mortgage. Your home equity is $170K.

**Caveat:** Don't count unrealized home appreciation as liquid wealth. You can't spend equity unless you sell or HELOC.

### Should I include my 401(k) in net worth calculations?

**Yes, absolutely.** Your 401(k) is an asset even though you can't access it without penalty until 59½. The Federal Reserve SCF data includes retirement accounts in net worth calculations.

**Vested vs. Unvested:** Only count vested balances. If your employer match vests over 4 years and you've worked 2 years, only count 50% of the employer contributions.

### What if my net worth is negative? What percentile is that?

Negative net worth typically places you in the 10th percentile or below, depending on how negative. This is common for:

- Recent college grads with student loans
- Medical/law school grads in residency
- Anyone with consumer debt exceeding assets

**Don't panic.** Negative net worth is a temporary state. Focus on:
1. Paying down high-interest debt (>7% APR)
2. Building emergency fund ($1,000 initially)
3. Contributing to 401(k) up to employer match
4. Aggressively paying down remaining debt

Most people exit negative net worth by age 30-35.

### How much does percentile vary by location?

SCF data is national, but cost of living varies dramatically:

- **High cost areas** (SF, NYC, LA): Percentiles skew higher (median 30-year-old may have $120K, not $90K)
- **Low cost areas** (Midwest, South): Percentiles skew lower (median may be $70K, not $90K)

**Recommendation:** Use national data as a baseline, but adjust mentally for your area. If you live in SF, reaching national 75th percentile might feel "average" locally. If you live in Iowa, reaching 50th percentile might feel "wealthy" locally.

### Can I reach the 90th percentile without a six-figure income?

**Mathematically: Yes.** Practically: It's very difficult.

**The math:** To reach 90th percentile ($800K) by age 39:
- Save $2,000/month for 17 years (starting at 22) at 7% return = $850K
- Requires income of $80K+ with 30% savings rate

**The reality:** Most people at 90th percentile either:
- Earn $120K+ and save 35-40%
- Had windfalls (stock options, inheritance, real estate appreciation)
- Started businesses that succeeded

**Bottom line:** It's possible with discipline, early start, and high savings rate, but most people need high income to get there.

### How often should I check my percentile?

**Recommendation: Quarterly (every 3 months).**

**Why not monthly?** Net worth fluctuates with market volatility. Monthly checks create emotional reactions to short-term noise.

**Why not annually?** You lose accountability. Quarterly is frequent enough to stay motivated without obsessing.

**Exception:** Check monthly if you're in high-growth phase (paying off debt aggressively, saving 40%+ of income). Daily updates via automated tracker are fine as long as you don't emotionally react to market dips.

## The Bottom Line

Net worth percentile by age is the most honest metric of financial progress. Unlike income, which measures earning power, percentile measures accumulated wealth—the result of your financial decisions over years.

**Key insights from Federal Reserve data:**

1. **The median 25-29 year-old has only $39,000** in net worth. If you have $50K+, you're ahead of most peers.

2. **The gap between percentiles widens with age.** At 25-29, the difference between 50th and 75th percentile is $95K. By 35-39, it's $285K. Compound interest and savings rate create exponential divergence.

3. **The top 10% (90th percentile) is achievable but requires discipline.** You need high income ($100K+) AND high savings rate (30-40%) AND early start (before age 30) AND consistency (no breaks in saving).

4. **Most Americans never reach the 75th percentile.** If you're in the top quarter, you're doing exceptionally well. Don't let social media or high-earning friends distort your perception.

5. **Percentile progress is the best motivation.** Tracking your movement from 55th to 60th to 65th percentile creates accountability. You see tangible results from your discipline.

**What to do now:**

1. **Calculate your current net worth** using the method above
2. **Find your percentile** using the tables in this article
3. **Set a goal** (e.g., "Reach 75th percentile by age 35")
4. **Track quarterly** to stay accountable
5. **Focus on high-impact actions:** Increase savings rate, pay down debt, invest consistently

Remember: **The goal isn't to beat everyone your age. The goal is to build enough wealth to achieve financial independence and live the life you want.** If you're in the 50th percentile and content with your lifestyle, you don't need to reach the 90th. But if you have ambitious goals—early retirement, financial freedom, generational wealth—then understanding percentiles shows you exactly what it takes to get there.
